# **C-Bit Manipulation**

C bit manipulation is a technique used in the C programming language to manipulate individual bits of data in a variable using bitwise operators. This allows for more efficient use of memory and faster code execution, as well as enabling tasks like setting or clearing individual bits, implementing custom data structures, compression algorithms, and cryptographic functions. The six bitwise operators in C are AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift.
