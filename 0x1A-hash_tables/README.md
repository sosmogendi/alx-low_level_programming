# Hash Table Implementation in C

This project aims to implement a hash table data structure in the C programming language. It focuses on understanding the concepts of hash functions, hash tables, collision handling, and the advantages of using hash tables. By completing this project, you will gain a better understanding of how hash tables work and their common use cases.

## Project Description

The project involves implementing a hash table data structure from scratch. It provides the necessary data structure definitions (`hash_node_t` and `hash_table_t`) that should be used for the implementation. Additionally, the project specifies learning objectives, requirements for coding style, and limitations such as avoiding plagiarism.

## Requirements

To meet the project's objectives, ensure that you adhere to the following requirements:
- Use the C programming language.
- Utilize the allowed code editors: vi, vim, or emacs.
- Compile your code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the provided compiler options.
- End each file with a new line.
- Follow the specified coding style using the Betty style checker.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Restrict the number of functions per file to a maximum of 5.
- Make use of the C standard library.
- Declare function prototypes in the `hash_tables.h` header file and include it in your implementation.
- Guard your header files against multiple inclusion.
