# **C - File I/O**
File Input/Output (I/O) is a way of interacting with files in the C programming language. It allows you to read data from files and write data to files.

The basic steps involved in working with files in C are:

Opening a file using the fopen() function, which returns a file pointer
Reading from a file using functions like fscanf() and fgets()
Writing to a file using functions like fprintf() and fputs()
Closing the file using the fclose() function
